# IMPORTANT

Currently IslandCustomized is very limited. We recommend using  [**Mod
Menu**](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/version/7.0.1) for the configurating.
Alternatively, you can do `/owo-config islandcustomized`. We're working on a better solution.

[**With that being said, you can download the mod
here.**](https://github.com/IcosphereIndustries/IslandCustomized/releases)

We'll publish the mod to Modrinth once it's more complete.

## Features

### Customization

* You can customize the death & victory messages in different gamemodes. More to come.
* Full RGB support. You can use HEX colors in the config by inserting them in the strings
  like this:

HEX colors: `<#ff0000>This is in red!`

[Vanilla codes:](https://www.digminecraft.com/lists/color_list_pc.php) `&c&lThis text is red and bold!`

## Development

### Setup

1. Clone the repository, do the obvious stuff
2. Load the project in your IDE. The project must be built once to generate the required files for our config system.
